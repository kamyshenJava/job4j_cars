This project is a web-site with ads for cars. It is made with the use of Spring boot, Thymeleaf, Hibernate. One needs to log in/sign up to be able to post ads. Once you are logged in, you'll see an "add a new ad" button. Also you can edit the ads you have previously added. To do this there are buttons "edit" on each of your ads. If you are not logged in, you see all the ads (from newest to oldest), but cannot add or edit any ads.
